These are my transcriptions of the example programs in _The Linux Programming Interface_, as well as my solutions to the exercise problems.
These are organized by chapter, with each chapter having the following basic structure:

├── ch04
    ├── examples
    │   ├── copy.c
    │   └── Makefile
    └── exercises

For now, the exercises have to be compiled locally, in the respective `/examples` or `/exercises` directory. The eventual goal is to add 
makefile support at a higher level so that the whole project can be built in one `make` command.
